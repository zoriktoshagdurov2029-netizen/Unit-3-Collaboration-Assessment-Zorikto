# Short Response

1. The first thing that each member needs to do is create a new branch by using "git branch feature/new-file-'your name,'" and then go to that branch by using "git checkout feature/new-file-'your name.'" This is important because this lets collaborators to avoid using the main branch since collaborators would work on the same branch which is challenging to cooperate in the same branch and it lets developers to change a branch without affecting the main branch. In conclusion, different branches give collaborators easier work by not affecting each other's work than disagreeing and agreeing on what to do in the same branch.

2.Developers use branches to diverge from the main branch, most common in collaboration, this lets developers to change a branch without affecting the main branch. As some people who are collaborators would use branch to diverge from the main branch in order to not affect the main branch.

3.Git: Git is a tool to manage control system.
Git hub lets developers use git with features such as collaboration, so developers can collaborate while using git in the Git Hub. Git Hub and Git work together by developers using it as a tool to manage control system.

4. The following command sequence is wrong because it uses git commit -m "saving work" first before git add . this would not result in a work being saved but rather give a error.
The correct command sequence: 
git add .
git commit -m "saving work"
git push
